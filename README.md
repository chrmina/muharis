# MUHARIS: Multi Hazard Risk Information System #
MUHARIS is based on MIRISK which was developed in 2007 for the World Bank with assistance from Government of Japan under Japan CTF by [Christakis Mina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismina) and Takahiro Tsutsumiuchi under the direction of Charles Scawthorn and the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (while Saroj K. Jha was the Program Manager).

## Introduction ##

MUHARIS is based on MIRISK. The original idea of MIRISK was to develop a web-based system that could provide sources of information for natural hazards design guidelines, norms and good practices and to allow its users to identify the natural hazards related to the development project, identify the typical vulnerability of each infrastructure and to identify normal design and mitigation plan of each infrastructure. MUHARIS will improve MIRISK.

MUHARIS aims to revamp MIRISK by:
* utilizing the latest Internet, Database and GIS technologies
* providing a simplified and streamlined user interface
* utilizing the latest research in natural hazards risk analysis
* estimating more accurately the losses to infrastructure from natural hazards

The loss estimation capability and mitigation of MIRISK was rudimentary. MUHARIS aims to improve that too. The loss estimation / optimization concept stays the same:

* Buildings are constructed based on the minimum requirements of building design codes.
* Building design codes are only a minimum level of design. That is, the purpose of normal building design codes is not to eliminate all damage given a natural disaster but rather to prevent major loss of life - significant damage is acceptable per modern building codes, if not many people die.
* A building can be strengthened by increasing the design level, i.e. design for values higher than the minimum building design levels. By doing so you incur higher construction costs but at the same time should a natural disaster occurs (i.e. an earthquake) the damages caused to the building will be minimized.

The question to answer is:

**What is the optimum design level that provides a balance between losses due to a specific natural disaster and the construction costs?**

In order to do so MUHARIS will help users to:
* identify the natural hazards affecting a region
* define the kinds of infrastructure ("assets") that make up typical development projects
* describe the vulnerability of these assets to natural hazards, and how vulnerability can be reduced
* analyze the natural hazards and vulnerability data, to assess whether projects should follow normal design practices, or whether the cost of some enhanced design for natural hazards is justified by the benefits (of avoided losses).
